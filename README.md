## Objectives required to complete
This quest has us working with methods and variables.


### Objective 1 - Designing a Plan 
Ensure you have all the necessary formulas in order to complete the tasks noted below.

### Objective 2 - Cloning
Don't forget to `Open from VCS` this repo into `IntelliJ` here.

### Objective 3 - Committing to Test Project for Functionality
Commit your code often to trigger testing to happen as you make progress on the quest.

## Quest Requirements
**All methods should be static and method names should be as stated in order to avoid errors on automated tests.

### Objective 1 - The methods
We have to make the proper calculations as described below in order to protect the kingdom from the invaders

- Distance to the enemy `howFar`

- Speed the enemy is travelling in miles per hour `howFast`

- Triangulation of the Quadratic
  - `getRootAdd`: Quadratic equation using `+`
  - `getRootSub`: Quadratic equation using `-`
	
### Objective 2 - Finishing the main
- Call all the methods on a variety of sample data in the main to fully test your formulas
- Display the various results to the user in a friendly format


### Objective 3 - Committing and Pushing
Reminder to commit and push code from `IntelliJ` back to GitHub.
